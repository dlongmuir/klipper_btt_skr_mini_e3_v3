# klipper_btt_skr_mini_e3_v3
Klipper Config for my Ender 3, Klipper, BigTreeTech SKR Mini E3 V3.0, Creality BLTouch, Adafruit NeoPixel Stick

Hopefully this helps you out, I got my klipper working by copying other people's `printer.cfg` files.

## Issues
 * Neopixel macros work in fluidd but aren't working when called in start_print
